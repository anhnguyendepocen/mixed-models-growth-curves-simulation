# mixed-models-growth-curves-simulation

Raw files for a document with results from a personal investigation into models for longitudinal data in small data situations (mixed models and growth curve models).  I still have to add Bayesian results at some point. [link to doc](http://m-clark.github.io/docs/mixedModels/growth_vs_mixed_sim.html)
